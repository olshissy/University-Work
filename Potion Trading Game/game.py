    There were two ADTs used in our Game class which were the AVL Tree and Hash Table.

    The AVL tree was for storing potions, using buy prices as key, in the inventory, ...

        This function follows the complexity of O(log(N)) where here N is the length of potion_valuations. The complexity of the first loop is then O(Nlog(N)).
        The second loop has complexity of M as it loops through all values in starting_money. Inside the loop, the while loop has worst case complexity N as it
        will continue to run till the money is gone which will worst case be until all potion quantity is exhausted. Therefore the complexity of this section is O(MN).
